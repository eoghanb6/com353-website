Dynamic web authoring group project

Using (X)HTML,CSS and JavaScript, but not a web editor, to create a user-friendly and interactive dynamic website (themes are attached). 
Students are required to analyse the design requirements, to apply the key concepts and methods covered during the module in the design, 
and to implement, test and evaluate the dynamic website. The website should contain multi-pages. The website should be standards-compliant
and is capable of gathering and conditioning data supplied by a user. Users should be able to browse all the information. 
Dynamic interactive design and event handling techniques (for examples, animation, banner, image effects, date/time, form validation, 
calculator and cookies) are required. Background research is essential.
