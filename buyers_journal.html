        </br>
            <p style="font-size:130%;" class="blog_body">Buying your first home is pretty scary, and one of the things that made me reluctant to start house hunting is that I thought it was going to be an almost impossible process. I’d heard many horror stories about how difficult finding the perfect home can be, and how the whole mortgage application process can be a nightmare. There’s also the risk of things falling through, gazumping, and losing money on all the fees you’ve paid out to solicitors etc. Scary.
                <h4 class="blog_head2">8th May &#58; Finding the property</h6>
                <p style="font-size:120%;" class="body"> Although living in the South East and being on a fairly low wage, I realised I could only afford a 1 bedroom apartment. I found this property on YouProperty and contacted the estate agents to arrange a viewing.
                </p>
                <h4 class="blog_head2">20th May &#58; Viewing the property</h6>
                <p style="font-size:120%;" class="blog_body">I went for my first viewing of the property, and it would also be my last and only viewing of a property! I decided there and then that I loved it and that it was perfect.
                </p>
                <h4 class="blog_head2">23rd May &#58; Mortgage in Principle</h6>
                <p style="font-size:120%;" class="blog_body">After spending a lot of time researching different mortgages etc, I called YouProperty to get free mortgage advice as well as a mortgage decision in principle. Their service is totally free, and I completely recommend it!
                </p>
                <h4 class="blog_head2">23rd May &#58; Making an Offer</h6>
                <p style="font-size:120%;" class="blog_body">As I was told that I could (most likely) get the amount I needed to afford the property, I made my first offer! It took a bit more haggling and my third and final offer was accepted!
                </p>
                <h4 class="blog_head2">2nd June &#58; Finding a Solicitor</h6>
                <p style="font-size:120%;">So I thought it would be a good idea to go with a solicitor that was local to me. That way I felt like I ‘knew’ them and I could just pop over if I had any issues.
                </p>
                <h4 class="blog_head2">22nd June &#58; Mortgage application approved!</h6>
                <p style="font-size:120%;">After providing lots more paperwork, bank statements, and wage slips, my mortgage was officially approved! The whole mortgage application process was actually much easier than I thought and because I used YouProperty, it meant that they did all the hard work for me!
